# Wikipedia Game
A basic python implementation of the 'Wikipedia Game'.

The Wikipedia Game is a game where you start on a given Wikipedia page, and must go from page to page in search of a certain word.

This script will automate searching of Wikipedia a page at a time, given a topic and key word input by the user.
The user is able to track each page that the script searches while it is doing so.
